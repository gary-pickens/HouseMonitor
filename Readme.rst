House Monitor Readme
####################

This is a program that runs a beaglebone computer and talks to to numerous XBee's running ZigBee protocol.  It can be monitoring
such thangs as a door state, turning on a LED or light or reading the temperature.  I will add more as I get time, and as I build more.

Here you can find the documentation in the docs direcotory, the main program in the housemonitor directory, and several auxilary programs
in bin.

I hape to add more documentation as time goes by.
